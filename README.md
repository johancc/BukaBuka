Bukabuka loves questions from weblab students. 

No questions make buka buka sad. 

You don't want to make Bukabuka sad.

## Setup

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run build`
3. `npm run start`
4. (In another terminal) `npm run start:client`

By default, the server uses port 3000 and the client uses port 8080. The client proxies request from '/api' to the server.
